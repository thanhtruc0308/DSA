We create a project that shows the population growth rate of Vietnam through a stacked bar chart and compares the population between provinces in Vietnam by map. Our project is coded in JavaScript programming language built using Visual Studio Code. The data on the population of Vietnam is obtained from the Kaggle page in the CSV file.

A stacked bar graph (or stacked bar chart) is a chart that uses bars to show comparisons between categories of data but with the ability to break down and compare parts of a whole. Each bar in the chart represents a whole, and segments in the bar represent different parts or categories of that whole. Stacked bars do a good job of featuring the total and also providing a hint as to how the total for each category value is divided into parts.

A Map chart allows us to visualize spatial relationships in data by indicating data on a geographical map. Geographical Areas - color areas on a map to indicate a value or a category of data for an area. For example, areas could be states of the United States and their color can indicate a numerical value for each state. This type of map chart in which we color geographical areas is known as a choropleth.
